# Outreach

Our lab has done outreach to the TD STEM Academy, the Tavern Hall Presevation Society and taught basic AI to various groups on campus.

We are committed to helping people *understand* AI and ML so that they can: 
- Identify all interactions with AI in daily life
- Critically evaluate AI use daily life
- Trust/not Trust AI appropriately
- Accurately anticipate risks as AI changes

Reach out to Dr. Brown to request an activity from us.
