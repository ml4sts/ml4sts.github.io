&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;title&lt;/strong&gt; How to anticipate risks in AI-enhanced research&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;abstract&lt;/strong&gt; ML-powered AI is increasingly appearing in all areas of research. However, ML is still in many ways a research output, more of a prototype than a polished, reliable, product. Even commercially released systems, because they are software, can be released without the same rigorous testing that commercially available research equipment has been traditionally be subject to. In this talk, I will draw connections between the ML research process and potential risks in applied ML and use of commercial AI in research.&lt;/p&gt;

developing a benchmark for fair data-driven decision making with LLMs.
We will develop a benchmark for both data analytics style decision-making and training fair models on data. Then we will assess state of the art AI systems engaging inn thse tasks across various levels of AI agency.&lt;/p&gt;
