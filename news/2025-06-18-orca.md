# ORCA-CAP Funding for Open Humanities

In Collaboration with [Madison Jones](https://web.uri.edu/harrington/meet/madison-jones/) and [Jeremiah Dyehouse](https://web.uri.edu/harrington/meet/jeremiah-dyehouse/) we recieved an award from the [Open Research Community Accelerator Catalytic Awards Program](https://www.orcaopen.org/work/cap) to build a reusable open source curriculum and hold a workshop for humanties scholars on the basics of open source. Our goal is to help humanities scholars embrace digitial methods without being locked into expensive, corporate controlled platforms.
