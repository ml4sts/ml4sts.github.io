# ML4STS lab

We study how to do Machine Learning for Socio-technical Systems. This means we apply data science using ML models to understand the world with other scientists, study and evaluate  ML systems directly, and build tools to help data scientists to employ best practices.  Most of our work right now focuses on fairness of automated decision making systems and some includes collaboration with other scientists.
